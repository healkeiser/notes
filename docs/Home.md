## VFX notes

This documentation is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [MkDocs Publisher](https://mkusz.github.io/mkdocs-publisher/) plugin, since I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take the notes. You can clone the repository and open it as an Obsidian Vault if you prefer reading it locally!

> [!warning]
> Some stuff might get displayed incorrectly in Obsidian.

> [!warning]
> You might notice a lot of `README.md` files, please ignore those - they're here to indicate attributes on directories for MkDocs Publisher. 

> [!note]
> If you spot any issue or have any recommendations, don't hesitate to send me an [email](mailto:valentin.onze@gmail.com).
