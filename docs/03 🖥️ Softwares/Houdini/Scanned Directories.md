## About

Houdini will scan different directories/files on start-up, if the said directories/files are added to the `$HOUDINI_PATH` prior to start-up. In order to do so, you can use `$HSITE` or `$HPREF` for example.

You can check all the scanned files by going to your Houdini installation folder, such as `C:\Program Files\Side Effects Software\Houdini <houdini version>\houdini` and see which directories/files are in there.
