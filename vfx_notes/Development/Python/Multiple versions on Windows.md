## How-to

If you want to handle multiple versions, here's an example on how to use PIP to intall the `mkdocs` plugin `exclude` for Python 3.7 and 3.9.

```shell
c:\users\valen\appdata\local\programs\python\python37\python.exe -m pip install mkdocs-exclude
```

```shell
c:\users\valen\appdata\local\programs\python\python39\python.exe -m pip install mkdocs-exclude
```

> [!note] Note 
>  All you have to do is call the right `.exe` according to the right Python version.
